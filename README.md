**Hack4Impact Technical Assessment**

- Next.js
- Tailwind
- Express/Nodemon backend server

npm run dev (for both the server and frontend)


**Personal Reflection**
Overall the project went well! It tested many different skills and made me think about how I wanted to design everything to work together. If I had to redo the project I would not use Next.js because the serverside rendering got too complex for the scope of this project and just is not needed for the amount of data that I was displaying. I would also have implemented different logic for getting the day's songs. Fetching them in the backend first so that if the app were to be deployed everyone would have the same songs and not have it generate 3 different songs on the frontend for each browser instance. I think for next year I would add a component of making the app responsive--as a requirement--because that is a very important skill for someone to have if they are going to be deploying apps for multiple people or an organization to be using. But overall, the project was fair and feasible if you were willing to put in the effort!
